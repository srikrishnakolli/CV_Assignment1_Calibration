Camera Calibration ➜ Real-World Dimension Estimation

This module has two parts:

Camera Calibration – print a calibration board, capture images, and compute your camera intrinsics and distortion.

Real-World Measurement – click/drag an ROI on a scene image and compute the object’s true width/height using perspective projection.

Everything runs locally on Windows/macOS/Linux with Python.
